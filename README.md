# unnamed-os
A 32-bit (for now) experiment on kernel level

## Goals:
I want this project to be a learning experience about x86 processors and low level hardware communication in general.
My approach is the [Lino Commando](https://wiki.osdev.org/Lino_Commando)-way, so don't expect anything too special.
I want to do something more organized than my last kernel, [yaOS](https://github.com/POGnator/yaOS/)
